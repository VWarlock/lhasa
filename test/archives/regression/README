abspath.lzh         - Archive containing a file with an absolute path.
                      For security reasons, file extraction should
                      always be done relative to the extraction path.
                      If extraction to absolute paths was permitted, it
                      would potentially allow arbitrary files on the
                      filesystem to be overwritten.

badterm.lzh         - Archive containing a file that includes an unsafe
                      terminal escape sequence (changes the title in the
                      terminal window). This terminal escape sequence
                      should not appear in list output.

dir.lzh             - Archive that just contains a directory.

truncated.lzh       - Unexpectedly truncated -lh5- archive.
