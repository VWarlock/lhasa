abspath.lzh         - Archive containing a file with an absolute path.
                      For security reasons, file extraction should
                      always be done relative to the extraction path.
                      If extraction to absolute paths was permitted, it
                      would potentially allow arbitrary files on the
                      filesystem to be overwritten.
