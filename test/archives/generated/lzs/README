These are test archives for testing -lzs- decompression. It seems that this
was an algorithm used by early versions of LArc, although I can't find any
that actually encode it. These archives have therefore been generated using
the lz5-to-lzs Python script, with hand-crafted headers.

lzs.lzs             - Archive containing -lzs- compressed file.
long.lzs            - Archive containing a large compressed file.
