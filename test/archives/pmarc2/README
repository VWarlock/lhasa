These files generated by the PMARC2 utility for MSX-DOS.
This was done using openMSX emulating an MSX2 (Philips_NMS_8250).

Information on the PMARC tool can be found here:

pm0.pma         - Archive with uncompressed file (/n option)
pm2.pma         - Archive with compressed -pm2- format file.
comment.pma     - Archive with a file that has a comment memorandum.
sfx.com         - Self-extracting PMA archive.

mtcd.pma        - Archive with compressed -pm1- format files.
                  This is one of precious few -pm1- files that can be
                  found in the wild, there aren't many of them. I
                  don't know what version of PMarc was used to
                  generate this. I include this as fair use.

                  This contains two archived files. mtcd.doc needs
                  deliberate padding with EOF bytes for the CRC to
                  extract correctly. cd.mtc does not.
