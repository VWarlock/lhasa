This is a small extract from an LHA archive generated by LHA for OS/2 v2.08:

   ftp://ftp.sac.sk/pub/sac/pack/lha2-208.zip

example.lzh is a chunk of source.lzh from this archive.  It is a tiny
(117 byte) text file which I believe to be fair use.

TODO: Replace this with a proper set of archives generated by LHA for OS/2.
