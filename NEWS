v0.0.3 (2012-04-22):

    Third beta release.

     * A fix has been added for a bug where missing parent directories
       were not being created properly.
     * Regression testing archives have been added from MacLHA v2.24.
     * In order to support MacLHA archives, code has been added that
       heuristically detects the MacBinary headers added by MacLHA
       and strips them off.

v0.0.2 (2012-04-17):

    Second beta release.

     * This version adds support for level 2 and 3 file headers. Lhasa
       should now be capable of decompressing most, if not all archives
       found in the wild.
     * A fuzz testing framework has been added for testing the
       decompression code. A couple of bugs have been fixed as a result
       of this.

v0.0.1 (2012-04-06):

    Initial version. This should be considered beta code, although this
    first version should already be capable of extracting the majority of
    archive files found in the wild. The main missing features are:

     * Lack of support for level 2 and 3 file headers.
     * Inability to create archives (only extract them).

    These are features that I aim to add in future releases. Other future
    features can be found in the TODO file.
